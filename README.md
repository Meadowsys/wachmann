# wachmann

[Galacon] [Discord server] moderation bot (not in production at the moment)

## download

Why would you?

Automated compiled builds are available on [Github Actions].

## supported platforms

- developed on macOS Monterey aarch64
- developed for debian-based distros (Ubuntu)
- likely works on macOS, Linux, or any Unix operating system
- not Windows (written using Unix specific features, like Unix sockets)

## dependencies

- [rust] (v1.60.0) (development/build)
- [node.js] (v16.14.2) (development/build/**production**)
- [pnpm] (v6.32.11) (development/build)
- [arangodb] (v3.9.1) (development/**production**)

## building for development

- start arangodb (if you didn't touch anything on install, it should be running as a system service so nothing needs to be done. if you did something else you would probably know what you need to do)
- `pnpm run dev` starts a file watcher to compile the typescript code on change
- `cargo r` builds and runs the rust code, which runs and connects to the typescript code

## building for production

- `pnpm run build` builds the typescript database connector code
- `cargo b --release` builds the rust code
- outputs: `target/release/db.mjs` and `target/release/wachmann`, only these two files are required in production

## required env variables

you can set them as usual, or alternatively, you can put them in a file called `.env` in the same directory as the programs, and both wachmann and the db will read variables from it

- `TOKEN`: discord bot token, ex: `eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.eeeeee.eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee`
- `ARANGO_URL`: url to connect to the arangodb url, ex: `http://127.0.0.1:8529`
- `ARANGO_USER`: arangodb user to authenticate as, ex: `wachmann-dev` (you can create this user using arangodb [web interface])
- `ARANGO_PASSWORD`: password of the arangodb user, ex: `very-secure-development-password-that-i-totally-didn't-just-commit-into-the-readme-of-this-repo`
- `ARANGO_DATABASE`: database to use, ex: `wachmann-dev-db` (you can create this database using arangodb [web interface], make sure to set your user as the owner of the database)

## running wachmann

note: you may need to run `chmod +x wachmann` and `chmod +x db-server.mjs` the first time if the files are not marked as executable

- `./db.mjs` first to start database connector thing
- `./wachmann` to start the bot
